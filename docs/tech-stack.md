## Delivery and Request Topology

- Public homepage, event discovery, public event detail, and public outcome or media delivery use public-safe payloads and may use cacheable SSR or static delivery. They do not wait for authenticated actor or capability data.
- `/account/**`, `/admin/**`, and prize-redemption workspaces use an immediate client-rendered or static shell. Their document delivery does not perform D1-backed authenticated SSR; every API still performs server-side session, consent, and authorization checks.
- The client has one typed account bootstrap containing session identity, platform account, consent, roles, and derived capabilities. The shared account client loads it once for a navigation or workspace and route guards and feature components consume that result. Feature-local `/api/session` calls and query-only tab actor refreshes are prohibited.
- Each authenticated API request resolves the request actor once and shares it across authorization and domain work. Login and account-link routes own identity reconciliation; ordinary API reads do not reconcile identities. Mutations enforce canonical platform authorization and current consent requirements.
- A normal HTTP platform-user actor lookup uses one strongly consistent D1 statement after the Auth0 session is read. That statement joins the Auth0 subject to the active platform user and computes current platform-document consent against the latest version of each required document type. The actor path must not reintroduce per-document or per-acceptance reads; `/api/session` may perform its separate role-assignment read for the bootstrap contract.
- Data-heavy event tabs use page-shaped JSON read endpoints. After account bootstrap, a tab has one critical data request, one authorization resolution, and one logical D1 request session. The endpoint returns the tab's first-render data in a typed contract; it is not a generic graph abstraction. Abandoned tab requests are cancelled, heavy tab code is locally bundled and lazy, and runtime `unpkg` editor dependencies are not supported.

## D1 Access and Consistency

- D1 access uses one shared request-scoped client and one logical session. Domain functions receive that access and do not create separate bindings, Drizzle clients, or session handles.
- Strong consistency is the only production HTTP database path. The request-scoped accessors do not expose a generic consistency option or a public-replica accessor; actor, consent, permission, lifecycle, mutation-result, and read-after-write paths use the primary session or an incoming bookmark.
- D1 Sessions bookmarks carry the causal position from a write or earlier session into a later read. A mutation/read sequence passes the latest bookmark or remains on primary; an unbookmarked replica read must not serve read-after-write data.
- The latest D1 Sessions bookmark is transported as the `X-D1-Bookmark` request and response header. It is request metadata and never appears in a domain response or request payload.
- Strong HTTP requests start with `first-primary`, unless an incoming `X-D1-Bookmark` carries a genuine opaque bookmark that anchors the session. The HTTP boundary rejects reserved or constraint-like values, including `first-unconstrained`, before calling `withSession`; clients cannot select an unconstrained session. A request uses one consistency constraint and one shared Drizzle client for all domain work. Raw SQL uses the same request session's `prepare` and `batch` methods.
- The application database passed to domain code is created from a capability-narrowed request-session binding containing only `prepare` and `batch`. It is an application query facade: no raw D1 binding, public Drizzle `$client`, session construction, or capability that can create, replace, or bypass the request session/bookmark is exposed. Raw request-session `prepare` and `batch` access is available only through `getDatabaseSession(event)`.
- The application facade is explicit and allowlisted rather than a forwarding membrane. Supported operations are bound to the request session and dangerous or unsupported capabilities fail closed. Harmless Drizzle builder metadata/configuration such as `dialect`, `$dynamic`, or `toSQL` may remain reachable when it cannot reach a raw client or another session; the architecture does not require recursive object-graph opacity. Reflective descriptors, prototype/constructor values, symbols, callbacks, and internal transaction entry points must not reintroduce a raw client, binding, or session. Runtime and type tests block session/client/binding construction and raw prepare/batch escape paths while proving supported builder, result, and same-session behavior.
- HTTP requests do not trigger startup or recovery work. Queue consumers and scheduled recovery entrypoints construct a fresh non-HTTP database for background processing; ordinary HTTP domain work receives the request-scoped application database or session.
- HTTP handlers cannot resolve or use the raw D1 binding or inject database access through H3 context. Standalone constructors remain in explicit queue, scheduler, migration, worker, and test adapters. Direct database injection is limited to explicit non-HTTP test or infrastructure execution and is held outside public request context. One actual Nitro `beforeResponse` hook emits the bookmark for both API and raw routes, including successful and handled/error responses.
- The same Nitro `beforeResponse` hook applies the API cache policy. Actor, product, and every other non-allowlisted `/api/**` response is `Cache-Control: private, no-store` with `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control: private, no-store`, including handled errors and returned `Response` bodies. The explicit public/versioned event and media allowlist may retain the exact documented public 30-second directives when both headers are present. The separate static-framework `/api/_nuxt_icon/*.json` allowlist preserves the generated framework cache headers for bundled static icon definitions; it is not a public product contract, and unknown generated-framework paths remain protected. No API handler opts into shared caching independently.
- The tracked local `wrangler.jsonc` keeps Workers Cache disabled because it is the local D1 and migration configuration. Generated deployment configs use a split entrypoint topology: top-level Workers Cache is enabled, the default Nitro gateway entrypoint has `cache.enabled=false`, and only the internal `PublicCache` entrypoint has `cache.enabled=true`. Because the gateway calls the named export through `ctx.exports`, generated configs explicitly include the `enable_ctx_exports` compatibility flag. The gateway runs before every external request and forwards only the explicit public homepage, event-detail HTML, public JSON, versioned-media, and static-framework allowlists after removing Cookie, Authorization, D1 bookmark, conditional, and other actor/request headers. Zone Cache Rules must bypass `/api/**` or honor origin no-store headers; they must not construct a shared cache key that ignores Cookie for protected APIs. Public/versioned cache behavior remains an explicit route-level contract and is verified remotely only through the opt-in operator smoke test.
- Source/reachability tests scan the full production `server/` tree and do not allow mixed HTTP/non-HTTP modules to bypass the request boundary.
- The local fake-D1 and Worker D1 adapters expose equivalent client, session, bookmark, and consistency behavior. The fake reports serving metadata from the query target it selected, routes only the first `first-primary` query to primary, and preserves sequential consistency for later reads. Tests exercise shared request reuse and read-after-write paths without test-only bypasses.
- Protected API timing exposes an aggregate `actor` phase plus non-sensitive `actor-session` and `actor-d1` subphases, and `database-session` measures request-session, binding, and application-facade construction. The former measures Auth0 session resolution and the latter measures the combined actor identity/current-consent D1 read; the `d1` phase remains for domain D1 work. A zero phase counter means that a handler did not instrument that phase, not that the request spent no time there.
- The capability-narrowed request-scoped D1 session adapter attributes every executed prepared statement and batch in the request timing system. `d1-exec-total` reports adapter attribution, execution/statement counts, active work, and bounded overflow; `d1-db-total` reports the known sum of D1 `timings.sql_duration_ms` plus unknown metadata count, attempts, and serving-location summary. Up to eight `d1-exec-N` entries identify the request-local ordinal, `prepare` or `batch` API, execution kind, status, statement count, adapter duration, known database duration, attempts, and bounded `served_by_region`, `served_by_colo`, and `served_by_primary` values. Batch entries may include bounded ordered per-statement SQL metadata without per-statement transport-duration claims. Missing or mixed result metadata is explicit; SQL text, bound values, results, identity data, table names, and raw binding/session capabilities are never emitted. In deployed Workers, `performance.now()` and `Date.now()` do not advance during CPU-only intervals, and totals can sum overlapping I/O durations, so `Server-Timing` is attribution evidence rather than authoritative wall, CPU, or critical-path timing; browser TTFB and Workers Trace/Tail measurements are authoritative.

## Media Delivery

- Managed public media covers event background and banner images, the platform default event background, and public event-gallery photo responses. Each resource gets a collision-free immutable private R2 object key before upload; D1 stores the active object pointer and the resource revision only after the R2 write succeeds.
- Event background, event banner, platform-default background, gallery photos, and user profile icons have independent object pointers and revisions. Event public HTML/JSON visibility uses a separate `public_content_revision`, which rotates for public media, gallery visibility/removal, submission public visibility, and event completion or hide/unhide changes.
- Public event and platform-default image URLs include the exact current resource revision and the required `variant`. Gallery URLs use `variant=preview` for a 720px `scale-down` transform or `variant=original` for a bounded 2400px full-display `scale-down` transform. Public variants stream through Cloudflare Images; stored R2 originals are never public fallbacks.
- Newly issued public event HTML, JSON, and managed media responses use `Cache-Control: public, max-age=30, stale-if-error=0` and `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control: public, max-age=30, stale-if-error=0`. They do not use `s-maxage`, long immutable freshness, or stale-on-error behavior.
- A Cloudflare cache hit can be served without invoking the Worker, and Cache API deletion is local to the executing data center rather than a global purge. D1 visibility and revision checks therefore apply on a miss or revalidation. The 30-second browser and edge freshness window is the revocation bound for newly issued managed URLs; the application does not use a runtime purge credential.
- Public managed-media routes validate visibility, the exact current revision, and the active object pointer before reading R2 or invoking Images. Removing or replacing media clears or rotates D1 and atomically records a fixed-kind cleanup intent in the D1 outbox; a scheduled Worker publishes pending eligible intents after the exact 30-second safety window, quarantines malformed rows with attempt/error metadata, and keeps producer failures pending, so HTTP mutations never wait for cleanup or add request fan-out. The consumer maps each kind to a configured R2 binding, acknowledges invalid or successful messages, retries transient bucket failures, and sends messages that exhaust configured retries to the managed-media DLQ. Migration-era stable keys remain valid cleanup targets, and cleanup failure leaves private bytes that no route can serve. Missing, invalid, or stale revisions return not found.
- Generated certificate PNG/PDF responses and winner or published-project profile icons remain private, `no-store` responses. `profileIconUpdatedAt` is metadata; profile-icon URLs use the independent numeric `profile_icon_revision`.

## Architecture Notes

- Auth0 is responsible for authentication and identity.
- Application authorization remains in the platform database through event roles, team roles, approvals, and related business rules.
- `Cloudflare D1` is the primary relational database.
- Meetup talk proposals and their decision-delivery state remain private canonical data in D1. Cloudflare Queue messages reference proposal records and never make proposal bodies public or synchronize agenda entries.
- Remote MCP uses `createMcpHandler` from `agents/mcp/server`, creates a fresh
  MCP server for every request, and stores no protocol session. Auth0 owns OAuth
  grants and credentials. Standards clients can use Auth0 Dynamic Client
  Registration, while configured HTTPS Client ID Metadata Documents are
  administrator-approved and reconciled for clients that use CIMD. D1 holds
  application data and hashes for optional manual MCP access tokens only.
- A dedicated Cloudflare Workers rate-limit binding applies the 120-request per
  manual credential or OAuth user/client pair per minute MCP envelope limit. The binding is
  protective and eventually consistent, not an accounting ledger.
