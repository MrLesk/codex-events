## A Shared Workspace For Events

Codex Events replaces the scattered forms, spreadsheets, judge sheets, tool exports, and email threads behind an event with one shared workspace for recurring or parallel events. Participants keep a reusable platform account; each event brings its own schedule, application flow, rules, roles, and outcomes.

## Event Types

You run three kinds of event from the same platform. Every event shares the same accounts, applications, approvals, and attendance. Meetups and builds stop there; hackathons add the competition layer on top.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Hackathon</strong><br />
      Full competition event.<br /><br />
      Apply &rarr; form a team &rarr; submit a project &rarr; blind and live-pitch judging &rarr; shortlist &rarr; winners, prizes, and a public project showcase.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <strong>Meetup</strong><br />
      Registration-only community event.<br /><br />
      Apply &rarr; get approved &rarr; attend.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Features

### Every event type includes

| Capability | How it helps |
| --- | --- |
| **Reusable accounts** | Participants register once and keep a profile, linked sign-in identities, and history across every event they join. |
| **Application-first registration** | Per-event registration windows, configurable application fields, required profile fields, and optional event-specific terms. |
| **Approvals and decision emails** | Review applications with staged approve/reject decisions or automatic approval, and notify participants of the outcome by email. |
| **Attendance and Luma sync** | Mark events in person, gate the venue address and Discord link to approved participants, and optionally verify Luma guests and sync check-ins. |
| **Event credits** | Offer redeemable credits — such as API or tooling credits — to approved participants from uploaded inventory. |
| **Galleries and feedback** | Share a private event gallery, publish selected photos, and collect anonymous post-event feedback. |
| **Explicit roles and audit** | Platform admins, event admins, event organizers, and staff are separate actors with scoped permissions and an audit trail. |

### Hackathons also add

| Capability | How it helps |
| --- | --- |
| **Team formation** | Solo or team participation, open-team join requests, team admins, and per-event team-size limits. |
| **Structured submissions** | Submission windows, tracks, summaries, repository and demo links, drafts, locking, withdrawal, and disqualification. |
| **Blind and pitch judging** | Configurable blind review (0–2 reviewers per project), a live pitch stage, pitch review, weighted scoring, and skipped-review redistribution. |
| **Shortlist and finalists** | Save the blind-review shortlist, set the finalist boundary, and run the live pitch lineup. |
| **Winners and prizes** | Announce winners, freeze prize eligibility, send winner notices, and track prize redemption against accepted winner terms. |
| **Public showcases** | A completed-event showcase of winning projects, plus opt-in public publishing for non-winning projects. |

## How It Runs

Codex Events runs in infrastructure you choose. Auth0 handles authentication. The platform handles authorization: platform roles, event roles, team roles, application state, judging assignments, prize eligibility, and event history live in platform data.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/readme/operating-stack.svg" width="100%" alt="Codex Events operating stack" />
</p>

The platform deployment uses:

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Application hosting and server-side execution. |
| **Cloudflare D1** | Primary relational database. |
| **Cloudflare R2** | Profile icons, event imagery, and gallery storage. |
| **Cloudflare Images bindings** | Protected gallery preview transformations. |
| **Cloudflare Queues** | Asynchronous email and Luma sync jobs. |
| **Cloudflare Email Service** | Outbound transactional email delivery. |
| **Cloudflare Cron Triggers** | Scheduled platform work. |
| **Auth0** | User authentication and linked identity resolution. |
| **Luma** | Optional event guest verification, approval/rejection sync, and attendance webhooks. |

The repository includes automation for recurring setup and maintenance:

- Auth0 setup for required app URLs, branding, custom domains, Actions, and account-linking callbacks.
- First platform-admin setup.
- Luma webhook setup for environments that enable Luma sync.
- Cloudflare queue, secret, migration, and deployment workflows.
- A GitHub Release driven production deployment workflow.

Remote test and production deployments are generated from environment-specific deployment variables, Cloudflare IDs, and runtime settings. Local Cloudflare bindings are documented in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Where It Fits

Codex Events is a good fit when your team wants to:

- run several events in parallel or as a recurring series — hackathons, meetups, and build events — from one platform;
- review and approve participants before they reach the event workspace;
- run registration-only community events with shared approvals, attendance, and credits;
- run hackathons with solo and team participation, blind and live-pitch judging, and prizes, without stitching separate tools together;
- keep platform-admin, event-admin, staff, judge, participant, and winner permissions explicit;
- host on Cloudflare with your own Auth0 tenant and deployment pipeline;
- keep participant data, competition state, and prize follow-up in one consistent record.

It may be more than you need if you only want a single static event page or an RSVP form.

## What You Bring

Plan for:

- a Cloudflare account with Workers, D1, R2, Images, Queues, Cron Triggers, DNS, Email Sending on a Workers Paid plan, and appropriate API tokens;
- an Auth0 tenant and Regular Web Application for the platform;
- an onboarded Cloudflare Email Service sending domain and verified sender address;
- production and, if desired, test domains;
- optional Luma API access when events use Luma guest sync or attendance webhooks;
- deployment-owned legal controller details, support and privacy contact addresses, and current Privacy Policy and Platform Terms content;
- people who can manage platform admins, event admins, judges, staff, and release access.

Before launch, configure platform legal settings and publish current platform documents from the platform-admin workspace or legal setup tooling. Public legal pages and account registration require those settings to be present.

Production setup, advanced deployment overrides, the optional test environment, and tuning settings are documented in [`OPERATOR.md`](OPERATOR.md). Environment-specific examples are available in [`.env.example`](.env.example), and local Cloudflare bindings are shown in [`wrangler.jsonc`](wrangler.jsonc).
