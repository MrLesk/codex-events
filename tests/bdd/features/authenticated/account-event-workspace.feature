Feature: Account event workspace browser topology
  Real Chromium navigation proves that authenticated account workspaces use the shared bootstrap and one page-shaped read.

  Scenario Outline: a direct account event tab uses one selected page read
    Given the saved "<persona>" local session state exists for account topology
    When I warm and measure a direct account event "<tab>" tab for event slug "<slug>" as "<persona>" with page family "<page>"
    Then the direct account event topology should have one bootstrap and one selected read without legacy fan-out
    And the measured account event topology should include a generous local timing budget
    And unrelated account event tabs should not request editor or sortable chunks
    And the browser topology should not request runtime CDN scripts

    Examples:
      | persona      | slug                              | tab          | page          |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | operations   | operations    |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | participants | participants  |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | submissions  | submissions   |
      | judge        | e2e-judging-fixture-event        | judging      | judging       |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | gallery      | gallery       |
      | platform_admin | public-overflow-fixture-event   | feedback     | feedback      |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | judges       | rosters       |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | staff        | rosters       |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | certificates | certificates  |
      | event_admin  | operations-fixture-event         | prizes       | prizes        |
      | regular_user | participant-approved-fixture-event | workspace    | workspace     |
      | regular_user | participant-team-join-fixture-event | teams        | teams         |
      | regular_user | e2e-judging-fixture-event        | judges       | rosters       |
      | judge        | e2e-judging-fixture-event        | judges       | rosters       |

  Scenario: a rejected participant Teams deep link returns the canonical forbidden code
    Given the saved "regular_user" local session state exists for account topology
    When I measure a forbidden direct account event "teams" tab for event slug "participant-rejected-fixture-event" as "regular_user" with page family "teams" expecting API error code "team_visibility_forbidden"
    Then the forbidden account event topology should return the expected API error without a data payload
    And the browser topology should not request runtime CDN scripts

  Scenario: direct settings loads the admin surface without legacy fan-out
    Given the saved "event_admin" local session state exists for account topology
    When I warm and measure a direct account event "settings" tab for event slug "operations-fixture-event" as "event_admin" with page family "settings"
    Then the direct account event topology should have one bootstrap and one selected read without legacy fan-out
    And the measured account event topology should include a generous local timing budget
    And the settings surface should expose its stable settings panel
    And the browser topology should not request runtime CDN scripts

  Scenario: the account event overview uses one entry read
    Given the saved "event_admin" local session state exists for account topology
    When I warm and measure the account event overview for event slug "operations-fixture-event" as "event_admin"
    Then the overview topology should have one session and one entry read
    And the measured account event topology should include a generous local timing budget
    And the browser topology should not request runtime CDN scripts

  Scenario: SPA tab changes reuse the account event bootstrap and entry state
    Given the saved "event_admin" local session state exists for account topology
    When I warm and measure the account event SPA flow for event slug "operations-fixture-event" as "event_admin" through tab "operations" with page family "operations"
    Then the SPA event topology should reuse its session and entry state
    And the measured account event topology should include a generous local timing budget
    And the browser topology should not request runtime CDN scripts

  Scenario Outline: global account workspaces use one critical read
    Given the saved "<persona>" local session state exists for account topology
    When I warm and measure the "<workspace>" global account workspace as "<persona>"
    Then the global account workspace topology should have one session and one critical read
    And the browser topology should not request runtime CDN scripts

    Examples:
      | persona      | workspace  |
      | regular_user | overview   |
      | judge        | judging    |
      | regular_user | redemption |

  Scenario: an abandoned Operations request cannot paint after navigating to Settings
    Given the saved "event_admin" local session state exists for account topology
    When I measure account event cancellation from Operations to Settings for event slug "operations-fixture-event" as "event_admin"
    Then the delayed Operations request should be cancelled without stale Settings paint
